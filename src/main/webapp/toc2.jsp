We may sometimes provide you with services that are not described in these Terms of Service, or customised services: unless we have entered into a separate, signed agreement that expressly supersedes these Terms of Service, these Terms of Service will apply to those services as well.<br><br>1.4 What the &quot;Terms of Service&quot; Means. These Terms of Service and the other documents referenced in them (including in Section 1.3 above) comprise MyBusinessPal.Com&#39;s &quot;Terms.&quot; These Terms are a legally binding agreement between you and MyBusinessPal.Com governing your access to and use of the Services and setting out your rights and responsibilities when you use the Services. By using any of our Services (including browsing a Site), you are agreeing to these Terms. If you do not agree to these Terms, please do not use or access the Services. If you will be using the Services on behalf of an entity (such as on behalf of your employer), you agree to these Terms on behalf of that entity and its affiliates and you represent that you have the authority to do so. In such case, &quot;you&quot; and &quot;your&quot; will refer to that entity as well as yourself.<br><br>2. MyBusinessPal.Com&#39;s Services and Role<br><br>2.1 What We Do. MyBusinessPal.Com&#39;s Services provide a simple and quick means for Organisers to create speaker profiles, organiser profiles, and other webpages related to their events, promote those pages and events to visitors or browsers on the Services or elsewhere online, manage online or onsite ticketing and registration, solicit donations, and sell or reserve merchandise or accommodations related to those events to Consumers or other Users. Descriptions of other and more specific services can generally be found on the Site of each of the MyBusinessPal.Com Properties.<br><br>2.2 How We Fit In. MyBusinessPal.Com is not the creator, organiser or owner of the events listed on the Services. Rather, MyBusinessPal.Com provides its Services, which allow Organisers to manage ticketing and registration and promote their events. The Organiser is solely responsible for ensuring that any page displaying an event on the Services (and the event itself) meet all applicable local, state, provincial, national and other laws, rules and regulations, and that the goods and services described on the event page are delivered as described and in an accurate satisfactory manner. The Organiser of a paid event selects the payment processing method for its event as more fully described in the Merchant Agreement. Consumers must use whatever payment processing method the Organiser selects. If the Organiser selects a payment processing method that uses a third party to process the payment, then neither MyBusinessPal.Com nor any of its payment processing partners processes the transaction but we transmit the Consumer&#39;s payment details to the Organiser&#39;s designated payment provider. If an Organiser uses MyBusinessPal.Com Payment Processing (as defined in the Merchant Agreement), MyBusinessPal.Com also acts as the Organiser&#39;s limited agent solely for the purpose of using our third party payment service providers to collect payments made by Consumers on the Services and passing such payments to the Organiser.</span>

There may come a time where either you or MyBusinessPal.Com decides it&#39;s best to part ways as described in Sections 4.2 or 4.3 below.

However, as described in Section 4.4, certain provisions will always remain applicable to both you and MyBusinessPal.Com.<br><br>4.2 MyBusinessPal.Com may terminate your right to use the Services at any time (a) if you violate or breach these Terms; (b) if you misuse or abuse the Services, or use the Services in a way not intended or permitted by MyBusinessPal.Com; or (c) if allowing you to access and use the Services would violate any applicable local, state, provincial, national and other laws, rules and regulations or would expose MyBusinessPal.Com to legal liability. MyBusinessPal.Com may choose to stop offering the Services, or any particular portion of the Service, or modify or replace any aspect of the Service, at any time. We will use reasonable efforts to provide you with notice of our termination of your access to the Services, where, in MyBusinessPal.Com&#39;s sole discretion, failure to do so would materially prejudice you.

If you are a Consumer using the Services without a registered account, your only option for these Terms to no longer apply is to stop accessing the Services indefinitely. So long as you continue to access the Services, even without an account, these Terms remain in effect. If there is a separate agreement between you and MyBusinessPal.Com governing your use of the Services and that agreement terminates or expires, these Terms (as unmodified by such agreement) will govern your use of the Services after such termination or expiration.<br><br>4.4 All provisions of these Terms that by their nature should survive termination of these Terms will survive (including, without limitation, all limitations on liability, releases, indemnification obligations, disclaimers of warranties, agreements to arbitrate, choices of law and judicial forum and intellectual property protections and licences).</span>

MyBusinessPal.Com will provide notice to you of any such Claim, provided that the failure or delay by MyBusinessPal.Com in providing such notice will not limit your obligations hereunder except to the extent you are materially prejudiced by such failure.

In no event may either we or you seek to resolve a dispute with the other as part of any purported class, consolidated or representative proceeding. Binding arbitration is subject to very limited review. Only the arbitrator appointed pursuant to this Section, and not any federal, state or local court will have the authority to resolve any dispute or claim relating to this Section including, without limitation, regarding the scope, enforceability and arbitrability of these Terms. This arbitration provision will survive termination of these Terms. These Terms evidence a transaction in interstate commerce and the interpretation and enforcement of this Section 9 is governed by the Federal Arbitration Act, notwithstanding the choice of law set forth in Section 9(h) below.<br><br>(c) Scope of Agreement.<br>This agreement to arbitrate is intended to be broadly interpreted as to legal disputes between you and us. It includes, but is not limited to: (i) all claims arising out of or relating to any aspect of the relationship between us, whether based in contract, tort, statute, fraud, misrepresentation or any other legal theory; (ii) all claims that arose before this or any prior agreement (including, but not limited to, claims relating to advertising); and (iii) all claims that may arise after termination of these Terms and/or your use of the Services.<br><br>(d) Exceptions.<br>Notwithstanding this Agreement to arbitrate, either party may (i) bring an action on an individual basis in small claims court (to the extent the applicable claim qualifies); or (ii) bring enforcement actions, validity determinations or claims arising from or relating to theft, piracy or unauthorised use of intellectual property in state or federal court in the U.S. Patent or Trademark Office to protect its Intellectual Property Rights (&quot;Intellectual Property Rights&quot; means patents, copyrights, moral rights, trademarks, and trade secrets, but not privacy or publicity rights).

THE ARBITRATOR MAY NOT CONSOLIDATE MORE THAN ONE PERSON&#39;S CLAIMS, MAY NOT PRESIDE OVER ANY FORM OF CLASS, CONSOLIDATED OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING AND MAY ONLY PROVIDE RELIEF IN FAVOR OF THE INDIVIDUAL PARTY SEEKING RELIEF AND ONLY TO THE EXTENT NECESSARY TO PROVIDE RELIEF WARRANTED BY THAT PARTY&#39;S INDIVIDUAL CLAIM.<br><br>(f) Notice of Dispute.<br>A party who intends to seek arbitration must first send to the other a written Notice of Dispute (&quot;Notice&quot;). The Notice to MyBusinessPal.Com must be addressed to the following address (&quot;Notice Address&quot;) and must be sent by certified mail: MyBusinessPal.Com, Inc., Attn: Legal Department, 155 5th Street Floor 7, San Francisco, CA 94103, USA. Notice to you will be addressed to a mailing, home or payment address currently on record with MyBusinessPal.Com and must be sent by certified mail. If MyBusinessPal.Com has no records of such physical address, such notice may be delivered to your MyBusinessPal.Com account email address. The Notice must (i) describe the nature and basis of the claim or dispute; and (ii) set forth the specific relief sought.

            href="https://www.adr.org/Rules"
            style="color: rgb(2, 120, 184); text-decoration: none; outline: 0px !important;" target="_self">Consumer Arbitration Rules</a> (in each case, the &quot;AAA Rules&quot;) of the American Arbitration Association (&quot;AAA&quot;), as modified by this Section 9, and will be administered by the AAA and settled by a single arbitrator. (The AAA Rules are also available by calling the AAA at 1-800-778-7879.) All issues in dispute between the parties are for the arbitrator to decide, including, but not limited to, issues relating to the scope, enforceability, and arbitrability of this Section 9.<br><br>(h) Location of Arbitration Proceedings. If you are a Consumer, any arbitration hearings will take place (at your option) either in the county of your residence or by phone, except that is you are a Consumer whose residence is outside of the United States, the hearing will take place either in San Francisco, California or by phone or videoconference, at your option and as permitted by the AAA Rules. If you are a business (i.e., your use of the Services were for commercial use), then unless MyBusinessPal.Com and you agree otherwise, any arbitration hearings will take place in a reasonably convenient location in the United States for both parties with due consideration of their ability to travel and other pertinent circumstances. If the parties are unable to agree on a location, AAA will determine the location. If your claim is for ten thousand dollars ($10,000) or less, we agree that you may choose whether the arbitration will be conducted solely on the basis of documents submitted to the arbitrator, through a telephonic hearing, or by an in-person hearing as established by the AAA Rules. If your claim exceeds ten thousand dollars ($10,000), the right to a hearing will be determined by the AAA Rules. Regardless of the manner in which the arbitration is conducted, the arbitrator will issue a reasoned written decision sufficient to explain the essential findings and conclusions on which the award is based. All decisions by the arbitrator will be final and binding and judgment on the award rendered may be entered in any court having jurisdiction.<br><br>(i) Costs of Arbitration; Legal Fees.<br><br>i. Payment of Costs and Expenses. Payment of all filing, administration, and arbitrator costs and expenses imposed by AAA will be governed by the AAA rules, provided that if you are initiating an arbitration against MyBusinessPal.Com and the value of the relief sought is ten thousand dollars ($10,000) or less, then MyBusinessPal.Com will advance all filing, administrative and arbitration costs and expenses imposed by AAA (subject to reimbursement as set forth below). Further, if the circumstances in the preceding sentence apply and your claim arises from your use of the Services as a Consumer, but the value of relief sought is more than ten thousand dollars ($10,000) and you demonstrate to the arbitrator that such costs and expenses would be more expensive than a court proceeding, then MyBusinessPal.Com will pay the amount of any such costs and expenses. In the event that the arbitrator determines that all of the claims you assert in arbitration are frivolous according to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11, you agree to reimburse MyBusinessPal.Com for all such cost and expenses that MyBusinessPal.Com paid and that you would have been obligated to pay under the AAA rules.<br><br>ii. Payment of Legal Fees. Just as in any court proceeding, each party will initially bear its own attorneys&#39; fees and expenses in connection with any arbitration. Should either party be determined to have substantially prevailed in the arbitration, then upon such party&#39;s request, the arbitrator will award such prevailing party the reasonable attorneys&#39; fees and expenses that it incurred in connection with the arbitration, provided that to the extent that the dispute or claim relate to your personal or household use of the Services (rather than business use) MyBusinessPal.Com will not seek to recover its attorneys&#39; fees and expenses in an arbitration initiated by you. The arbitrator may make rulings and resolve disputes as to the reimbursement of attorneys&#39; fees and expenses upon request from either party made within fourteen (14) days of the arbitrator&#39;s ruling on the merits.<br><br>(j) Future Changes. Notwithstanding any provision in these Terms to the contrary, you and MyBusinessPal.Com agree that if MyBusinessPal.Com makes any future change to this arbitration provision (other than a change to the Notice Address) MyBusinessPal.Com will provide you with notice of such change and you may reject any such change by sending us written notice within thirty (30) calendar days of the change to the Notice Address provided above. By rejecting any future change, you are agreeing that you will arbitrate any dispute between us in accordance with the language of this provision as unmodified by such rejected change.<br><br>(k) Special Severability.<br><br>In the event that any provisions of this Section 9 are found to be invalid or unenforceable for any dispute or claim, then, the entirety of this Section 9 will be null and void with respect to such dispute or claim and Section 23 will apply in lieu of this Section 9.<br><br>(l) Opt Out.<br><br>You have the right to opt out and not be bound by the arbitration or class action waiver provisions set forth above by sending (from the email address we associate with you as a User) written notice of your decision to opt-out to&nbsp;<a

Creating an account, listing an event and accessing the Services are free. However, we charge fees when you sell or buy paid tickets or registrations. These fees may vary based on individual agreements between MyBusinessPal.Com and certain Organisers. Organisers ultimately determine whether these fees will be passed along to Consumers and shown as &quot;Fees&quot; on the applicable event page or absorbed into the ticket or registration price and paid by the Organiser out of ticket and registration gross proceeds. The fees charged to Consumers may include certain other charges, including without limitation, facility fees, royalties, taxes, processing fees and fulfillment fees. Therefore, the fees paid by Consumers for an event are not necessarily the same as those charged by MyBusinessPal.Com to the applicable Organiser or the standard fees described on the Services to Organisers. In addition, certain fees are meant, on average, to defray certain costs incurred by MyBusinessPal.Com, but may in some cases include an element of profit and in some cases include an element of loss. MyBusinessPal.Com does not control (and thus cannot disclose) fees levied by your bank and/or credit card company, including fees for purchasing tickets and registrations in foreign currencies or from foreign persons. Be sure to check with your bank or credit card company prior to engaging in a transaction to understand all applicable fees, credit card surcharges and currency conversion rates.<br><br>14.2 Ticket Transfers. If you wish to transfer tickets to an event you have purchased on MyBusinessPal.Com, in some instances MyBusinessPal.Com may be able to accommodate this for you.
