 * @author ennisa To charge a credit card or other payment source, you create a Charge object. Rule If your API key is in test mode, the supplied payment source (e.g., card) wonâ€™t actually be charged, although everything else will occur as if in live mode. (Stripe assumes that the charge would have completed successfully).

 * Errors com.stripe.exception.InvalidRequestException: You have insufficient funds in your Stripe account. One likely reason you have insufficient funds is that your funds are automatically being paid out; try enabling manual payouts by going to https://dashboard.stripe.com/account/payouts.; code: balance_insufficient com.stripe.exception.InvalidRequestException: Insufficient funds in Stripe account. In test mode, you can add funds to your available balance (bypassing your pending balance) by creating a charge with 4000 0000 0000 0077 as the card number. You can use the the /v1/balance endpoint to view your Stripe balance (for more details, see stripe.com/docs/api#balance).; code: balance_insufficient
