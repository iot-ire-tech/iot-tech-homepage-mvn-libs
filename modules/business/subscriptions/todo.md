## Stripe
We've noticed that your Stripe account balance has fallen into the negative. We know that businesses around the world are having a challenging time right now and you might be seeing increased refunds. We wanted to reach out so we can continue to support your business and your customers.	
A negative balance means your customers will not be able to get their refunds as expected. To help fix this, a debit in the amount of €1.27 will be initiated from your bank account in order to make your Stripe account balance whole again. The debit may appear in as soon as two days. You can keep an eye on the status of the debit in your dashboard, and it’ll also appear on your bank statement as "Stripe" with creditor identifier DE16ZZZ00001941136.	
You can read more on how debiting works in our support docs. Right now, our priority is to help you fulfill your customers’ expectations and to continue to support your business—not just through this crisis—but beyond. If you have any other questions, please don’t hesitate to reply to this email. We’re here to help.	
If you have questions, contact us at support@stripe.com.	
 
## Lets Encrypt (Let's Encrypt Expiry Bot)
Hello,
Your certificate (or certificates) for the names listed below will expire in 20 days (on 18 Apr 20 15:24 +0000). Please make sure to renew your certificate before then, or visitors to your website will encounter errors.
We recommend renewing certificates automatically when they have a third of their
total lifetime left. For Let's Encrypt's current 90-day certificates, that means
renewing 30 days before expiration. See
https://letsencrypt.org/docs/integration-guide/ for details.

For any questions or support, please visit https://community.letsencrypt.org/. Unfortunately, we can't provide support by email.
For details about when we send these emails, please visit https://letsencrypt.org/docs/expiration-emails/. In particular, note that this reminder email is still sent if you've obtained a slightly different certificate by adding or removing names. If you've replaced this certificate with a newer one that covers more or fewer names than the list above, you may be able to ignore this message.
