 Plans are at the heart of subscriptions
 * establishing the billing cycle, currency, and base cost.
 - product Id
 - amount
 - interval
 - currenty (hese three attributes are all fixed on a plan once created,)
 Every plan is attached to a product
 * which represents the application or service offered to customers.
 Products can have more than one plan
 * reflecting variations in price and durationâ€”such as monthly and annual pricing at different rates.
 - name
 - type
 - meta


 Eg:
 Product IOT Subscription
 - plan: entry level
 - plan: pro level
 - plan: prem level
 The product will have three different plans now associated with it!

 Product - Squash/Swiming
 - plan: entry level
 - plan: pro level
 - plan: prem level

 # Subscriptions
 If your business offers multiple products, subscribe your customer to multiple plans on a single subscription.
 This generates a single invoice each billing period that combines every plan.
 Only a single payment for that invoice is required, reducing your costs and the number of charges your customer sees.

 Subscription : Mega Deal
 Plan: Squash SummerCamp
 Plan: Swimming Daily
 Plan: Gym Niglty
