8. This project is sponsored by Rosie Barry (President of Irish Squash). The team is made up of Rosie Barry, Paul Nugent, Eugene Walker (Munster), Gerry Galvin (Connacht), Mark Gilliand (Ulster) and me (Leinster), Andrew Gillespie, David Ayerst, David Noone and Conor O'Hare. I am leading the project. 


## Phases
The project has two stages 
1. Evaluate & Select a candidate and then 
2. Implement the platform. 

We are at the start of the first stage, and hope to have a candidate selected by the end of September.   
Right now the team is consolidating requirements against a wide range of headings   

## Category of requirements
* Commercials/Pricing
* Technology, 
* Player Services, 
* Event/Tournament Management, 
* Ranking, 
* Club Management, 
* Provincial & National Body Management
* etc
 
to present to the different companies in early September. 
Once we have a candidate selected (which is approved by the Board) we could move to the second stage of implementation in October. 
Although it is early days and we have little detail regarding the implementation plan at this point,
it will be founded on the principle of voluntary adoption by stakeholders in the community over the years to come. 
This principle is built into our evaluation considerations right now.

If you have any questions, want to get further information on the project or wish to raise any requirements please get back to me or Andrew Gillespie over the course of August.
